WIP:

Goal is to have a library with simple and easy to use implementations of popular ML algorithms, including:
- linear regression
- logistic regression
- decision tree
- random forest
- Feed Forward Neural Network
- And more...

In addition, it will include different plotting functions to make understanding of the underlying algorithm easier.
